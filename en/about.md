Hi there. This is Ji Yu-Qing <audio width="200" height="30" src="./../name.mp3" controls="controls">[dʒɪ(falling tone) ju(dipping tone) tsɪŋ(high-level tone)]</audio> and welcome to my channel.

I do not know what to say when people ask me to introduce myself cause I am not several words. But if you don't tag yourself, people will still tag you, even worse, in a way you don't want to see. So it may be better for me to do it.

I was born and raised up in Shanghai, China. 

A no barbie but chess/poker/pet/calligraphy/sketch/pipa childhood - thanks to my parents.

Studied Applied Psychology in the university - an accident I would say but not that bad journey. 

Tried to be a counselor/marketing researcher/data analyst/account manager/project manager -- realize what I am interested in, relatively, and more importantly, how little I know.

Playing a QA/Devops role in a startup for the moment - the highlight of the work is my code does solve a real problem. 

Really enjoy solving problems, especially the ones which I have never tried before.

Prefer micro than macro - happy to see myself getting more practical -- keep truth to myself, face the problem then just try to solve it.
