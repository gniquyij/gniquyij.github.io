Hi there. This is Ji Yu-Qing <a target="_blank" href="./../name.mp3">|dʒɪ ju tsɪŋ|</a> and welcome to my channel.

I was born and raised up in Shanghai, China. 

Studied Applied Psychology in the university - an accident I would say but not that bad journey. 

Tried to be a counselor/marketing researcher/data analyst/account manager/project manager -- realize what I am interested in, relatively, and more importantly, how little I know.

Playing a QA/Devops role in a startup for the moment - the highlight of the work is my code does solve a real problem. 

Really enjoy solving problems, especially the ones which I have never tried before.

Prefer micro than macro - happy to see myself getting more practical -- keep truth to myself, face the problem then just try to solve it.
