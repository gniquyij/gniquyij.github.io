# QA Not-To-Do

Here are the things I’ve been trying to avoid as a Quality Assurance, in no particular order.

- Make an assumption without a validation. 

Developers always assume no bugs in their code.

- No documents. 

Can you remember everything?

- No expectations. 

You do not know what you are going to test. What are you going to test?

- No patience.

- No priority.

You would not have time for a blocking issue cause you spent your time on a non-blocking.

- No scope. 

People will define the scope if you don't.

- Repeat myself. 

People think QA is a job requiring repeating - once found an issue, reproducing, debugging, verifying, etc.. Is there any other way to get them done?

- Think dependently.
