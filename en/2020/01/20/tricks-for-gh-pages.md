# Tricks for your Github Pages

This blog is based on [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com).
During use, the following tricks make me much easier to write/grow the blog.

## Write in Markdown

I need to do something as I know to let the blog support Markdown so I wrote in HTML before...
Just write your pages in Markdown and you can find your content well formatted in the browser.

## Connect you and your projects

Each Github repository can have its own pages with a branch called gh-pages which includes the page files.
Take [what i did](https://github.com/vjyq/satsie/commit/fdba634322ebda88d450a9bd054a4be50b25a5f8) for [satsie](https://github.com/vjyq/satsie) as an example,
the index page for satsie is available at [vjyq.github.io/satsie](https://vjyq.github.io/satsie) - just another page in your blog.
